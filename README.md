## volume definitions
[Explanation Article](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth)


Maintenance Volume (MV) - How much volume you need to maintain your gains.

Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) - The least amount of volume needed to make gains.

Maximum Adaptive Volume (MAV) - The range of volumes in which you make your best gains. Itâ€™s a much more of a range than the other volume landmarks because it changes greatly within each training mesocycle (week to week).

Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV) - The total amount of volume above which you start impeding your progress. (i.e. above which you get negative return on investment)

Session MAV is typically around 6-10 for most muscle groups. 


[1] when 0, it is assumed you still hit these muscle groups with non-direct compound work, e.g.:
* traps in deadlift
* front delts in bench press
* rear delts with bent over row
* triceps in overhead press
* forearms with pull ups
* glutes in squats
