## volume definitions
Maintenance Volume (MV) - How much volume you need to maintain your gains.

Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) - The least amount of volume needed to make gains.

MAV = Maximum Adaptive Volume (MAX) - The range of volumes in which you make your best gains. Itâ€™s a much more of a range than the other volume landmarks because it changes greatly within each training mesocycle (week to week).

Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV) - The total amount of volume above which you start impeding your progress. (i.e. above which you get negative return on investment)
